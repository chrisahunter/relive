# Shiitake (Lentinula edodes) — Practical Guide for Health Chatbots
_Last updated: 2025-10-10_

## Quick Take
Shiitake is both a **food** and a **source of lentinan**, a β‑glucan investigated as an **adjunct in oncology** and for **immune modulation**. Culinary shiitake is nutrient‑dense and a natural source of **vitamin D** (when UV‑exposed).

## Identity & Compounds
- **Species:** *Lentinula edodes*  
- **Key compounds:** **Lentinan** (β‑1,3/1,6‑glucan), eritadenine, ergosterol (→ vitamin D₂ with UV), polysaccharides

## Evidence Snapshot
- **Adjunct oncology (lentinan):** Clinical experience (esp. in Asia) as an adjuvant; mechanisms include macrophage/NK modulation.  
- **Cardiometabolic:** Eritadenine and fibers may support cholesterol profiles (mixed quality evidence).  
- **Immune & inflammatory markers:** Improved surrogate markers reported in some studies.

## Food vs Extracts
- **Food use:** Widely consumed; sautéed/roasted, soups, teas.  
- **Extracts:** Lentinan (injection in some settings) or oral β‑glucan products with variable standardization.

## Safety
- **Shiitake dermatitis:** A linearly distributed, itchy rash can occur after raw/undercooked shiitake due to lentinan; resolves with time.  
- Typical food amounts are safe; supplement forms require the usual cautions (allergy, interactions).

## Chatbot Prompt Snippets
