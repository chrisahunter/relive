# Maitake (Grifola frondosa) — Practical Guide for Health Chatbots
_Last updated: 2025-10-10_

## Quick Take
Maitake (hen‑of‑the‑woods) contains **β‑glucans** linked to **immune modulation** and has preliminary evidence for **metabolic** and **hematologic** support. Clinical findings are mixed and often small; one MSKCC trial noted a **dual immune effect** (stimulation and suppression depending on dose).

## Identity & Compounds
- **Species:** *Grifola frondosa*  
- **Key compounds:** D‑fraction and related β‑glucans; glycoproteins; ergothioneine

## Evidence Snapshot
- **Immune modulation:** Changes in cytokines/hematopoiesis in small clinical studies.  
- **Myelodysplastic syndromes:** Pilot data suggested stimulation of granulocyte colony‑stimulating factor production.  
- **Metabolic markers:** Early evidence for glycemic/lipid support; more trials needed.

## Food vs Extracts
- **Culinary mushroom** with rich umami; safe as food.  
- **Extracts:** D‑fraction and proprietary forms; standardization varies.

## Safety
- Generally well tolerated; GI upset possible.  
- Theoretical interactions with **antihyperglycemics** or **immunomodulators**.
