# Chaga (Inonotus obliquus) — Practical Guide for Health Chatbots
_Last updated: 2025-10-10_

## Quick Take
Chaga is rich in **melanin**, **polyphenols**, and **β‑glucans**, with strong **antioxidant** and **anti‑inflammatory** signals in lab studies. **Human evidence is limited**; safety considerations include **oxalate load** and potential interactions with **antidiabetic** or **anticoagulant** therapy.

## Identity & Chemistry
- **Species:** *Inonotus obliquus* (sterile conk on birch)  
- **Key compounds:** Polysaccharides (β‑glucans), triterpenoids (inotodiol, betulinic acid via birch), melanin complexes, polyphenols

## Proposed Mechanisms
- **Antioxidant & anti‑inflammatory** actions across preclinical models  
- **Metabolic effects:** Signals for glycemic and lipid modulation in animals  
- **Antiviral/antitumor** activities observed in vitro/animals

## Evidence Snapshot
- **Human:** Sparse clinical data; mostly surrogate markers or case series.  
- **Preclinical:** Robust antioxidant/anti‑inflammatory findings; exercise endurance and antidiabetic signals in animals.

## Potential Use Cases (preliminary)
- **Metabolic support (adjunct):** 🧪 animal signals; human data lacking.  
- **General antioxidant support:** 🧪 Preclinical only.  
- **Cancer adjunct:** Investigational only; no claims.

## Forms, Dose & Prep
- **Tea/decoction, powders, capsules, tinctures**; dosing varies widely.  
- Traditional decoctions use simmered chunks; modern extracts often standardized to polysaccharide content.

## Safety & Interactions
- **Oxalates:** Chaga may be **high in oxalates**; theoretical kidney stone risk with heavy use.  
- **Drug interactions:** Caution with **antidiabetic meds** (hypoglycemia risk) and **anticoagulants**.  
- **Autoimmune conditions/pregnancy:** Insufficient data—avoid unless advised by clinician.

## Quality Notes
- Verify **species and source** (sustainable harvesting, contaminant testing).  
- Birch‑derived betulin/betulinic acid content may vary by source/extraction.
