# Cordyceps (C. militaris / Ophiocordyceps sinensis) — Practical Guide for Health Chatbots
_Last updated: 2025-10-10_

## Quick Take
Cordyceps is marketed for **energy, endurance, and oxygen utilization**. Preclinical research is extensive; human exercise studies show **mixed results**, with some improvements in tolerance under specific conditions. Product species vary (cultivated *C. militaris* vs wild *O. sinensis*).

## Identity & Chemistry
- **Species:** Cultivated *Cordyceps militaris* (fruiting body) and *Ophiocordyceps sinensis* (wild, scarce); many supplements use **mycelial culture**.  
- **Key compounds:** Cordycepin (3’-deoxyadenosine), adenosine, polysaccharides, sterols

## Mechanisms (proposed)
- **Mitochondrial and ATP‑related effects** via cordycepin/adenosine signaling (preclinical).  
- **Vasodilation & oxygen utilization** pathways suggested.  
- **Immunomodulation/anti‑inflammatory** effects in animal models.

## Evidence Snapshot
- **Exercise performance:** Small RCTs show variable benefits (e.g., tolerance to high‑intensity exercise in some studies); results are inconsistent.  
- **Metabolic & immune markers:** Preliminary improvements reported in limited trials.  
- **Oncology/hepatorenal:** Mostly animal/in vitro.

## Forms & Dosing
- Extract powders/capsules from *C. militaris* fruiting bodies or mycelium; labeled ranges often 1–3 g/day dry equivalent.  
- Standardization to **cordycepin** or **β‑glucans** is helpful but not universal.

## Safety
- Generally well tolerated; occasional GI symptoms.  
- **Interactions:** Theoretical interactions with anticoagulants, hypoglycemic agents, and immunomodulators.  
- **Allergy/autoimmune:** Caution as with other fungi.

## Quality
- Confirm **species, part used, and cordycepin content**; beware of mycelium grown on grain (lower active content by weight).

## Chatbot Prompt Snippets
- “Does cordyceps actually improve VO₂ or time to exhaustion?”  
- “What’s the difference between *C. militaris* and *O. sinensis* in supplements?”  
- “What is cordycepin?”
