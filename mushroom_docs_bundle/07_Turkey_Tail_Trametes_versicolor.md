# Turkey Tail (Trametes versicolor) — Practical Guide for Health Chatbots
_Last updated: 2025-10-10_

## Quick Take
Turkey Tail contains **PSK** (polysaccharide‑K) and **PSP**, well‑known mushroom polysaccharides studied as **adjuncts in oncology**, particularly in Japan where PSK has been approved as an adjunct. Human evidence focuses on **immune function** alongside standard therapy.

## Identity & Compounds
- **Species:** *Trametes versicolor* (syn. *Coriolus*/*Polyporus versicolor*)  
- **Key compounds:** **PSK**, **PSP**, β‑glucans and related proteoglycans

## Evidence Snapshot
- **Oncology adjunct:** Evidence base includes randomized trials with PSK added to chemotherapy/radiation in certain cancers (Japan); outcomes vary by setting.  
- **Immune function:** Studies show enhanced innate and adaptive immune parameters.

## Forms & Dosing
- **Extracts:** Standardized PSK/PSP products (availability varies by country).  
- **Teas/capsules:** Non‑standardized supplements common in the West.

## Safety
- Generally well tolerated; GI upset possible.  
- **Drug interactions:** Potential with immunotherapies and anticoagulants—coordinate with oncology teams.

## Chatbot Prompt Snippets
- “What is PSK and how is it used with chemotherapy?”  
- “Is PSP the same as PSK?”  
- “Can I just drink turkey tail tea?”
