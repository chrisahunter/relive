# Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum) — Practical Guide for Health Chatbots
_Last updated: 2025-10-10_

## Quick Take
Reishi is one of the most famous “medicinal mushrooms” in East Asian traditions. Modern research suggests **immunomodulatory** activity and potential roles as an **adjunct** to cancer therapy, but high‑quality clinical evidence is limited and mixed. Safety matters: reishi can **increase bleeding risk** and may interact with **immunosuppressants**.

## Taxonomy & Identity
- **Common names:** Reishi, Lingzhi, Mannentake  
- **Species:** *Ganoderma lucidum* (note: some products use related *Ganoderma* spp.)  
- **Part used:** Fruiting body, mycelium, spore powder  
- **Key compounds:** Triterpenoids (ganoderic acids), polysaccharides (β‑glucans), sterols

## Proposed Mechanisms
- **Immune modulation:** β‑glucans may prime innate immunity (e.g., macrophages, NK cells).  
- **Anti‑inflammatory/antioxidant:** Triterpenes show antioxidant and NF‑κB–modulating effects in preclinical studies.  
- **Adjunct oncology interest:** Lab/animal data suggest radiosensitizing or chemosensitizing effects; human evidence remains preliminary.

## Evidence Snapshot
**Human data:** small studies and adjunct trials suggest improvements in immune parameters or quality of life; robust endpoints (survival, tumor response) are not well established.  
**Animal/in vitro:** consistent signals for immunomodulation and anticancer pathways.  
**Quality caveats:** Many trials are small, heterogeneous, and use non‑standardized extracts.

## Potential Use Cases (Evidence Strength: 🔬 = preliminary, 🧪 = lab/animal, ✅ = some human data)
- **Immune support (adjunct):** ✅/🔬 Changes in immune markers reported in small trials.  
- **Cancer adjunct (with standard care):** 🔬/🧪 Investigational; do not replace conventional treatment.  
- **Fatigue/quality of life:** 🔬 Mixed and small studies.

## Forms, Dose & Prep (Illustrative, not medical advice)
- **Tea/decoction:** traditional use with sliced fruiting bodies simmered 20–30 min.  
- **Extracts:** capsules or powders standardized to β‑glucans or triterpenes.  
- **Common labeled ranges:** 1–3 g/day dry equivalent of fruiting body; **standardization varies widely**.
> Always verify third‑party testing; mislabeling/adulteration is common in global markets.

## Safety, Interactions & Contraindications
- **Bleeding risk:** Reishi may **increase bleeding**, especially with anticoagulants/antiplatelets.  
- **Immunosuppression:** May **counteract** immunosuppressive therapy; discuss with clinician.  
- **Hepatotoxicity:** Rare case reports of **liver injury** (often with spore powders or high doses).  
- **Pregnancy/lactation:** Insufficient data; avoid unless advised by a clinician.  
- **Allergies:** Possible in mushroom‑allergic individuals.

## Sourcing & Quality
- Prefer **fruiting body extracts** with verified β‑glucan content and contaminant testing (heavy metals, pesticides).  
- Avoid products that do not disclose species, part used, extraction ratio, or testing.
