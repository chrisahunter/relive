# Lion’s Mane (Hericium erinaceus) — Practical Guide for Health Chatbots
_Last updated: 2025-10-10_

## Quick Take
Lion’s Mane is popular for **cognitive and nerve‑health claims**. Preclinical data are compelling (nerve growth factor–related activity), but **human evidence is mixed**: small studies suggest benefits in older adults with mild cognitive impairment, while a 2024 trial found **no cognitive improvement in healthy young adults**.

## Taxonomy & Identity
- **Common names:** Lion’s Mane, Yamabushitake, Houtou  
- **Species:** *Hericium erinaceus*  
- **Key compounds:** Hericenones, erinacines (NGF‑modulating), β‑glucans

## Proposed Mechanisms
- **Neurotrophic:** Erinacines/hericenones may influence NGF pathways in preclinical models.  
- **Anti‑inflammatory/antioxidant:** May support neuronal resilience.  
- **Gut‑brain axis:** Polysaccharides might modulate microbiota; evidence preliminary.

## Evidence Snapshot
**Human:** Small RCTs show cognitive/subjective improvements in older adults with mild cognitive issues; **null results** in healthy young adults (2024).  
**Animal/in vitro:** Neurogenesis, myelination support, and anti‑inflammatory effects reported.  
**Quality caveats:** Product heterogeneity (mycelium vs fruiting body), short durations.

## Potential Use Cases
- **Age‑related cognitive complaints:** 🔬 Some positive signals in small trials.  
- **Mood/nerve health:** 🔬 Early signals; more research needed.  
- **General cognitive enhancement in healthy adults:** ⚠️ **No consistent benefit**.

## Forms, Dose & Prep
- **Fruiting body powder/extract:** Often 1–3 g/day equivalent; standardization varies.  
- **Mycelium products:** Different compound profile (often more erinacines if cultivated for them).  
- **Food use:** Edible culinary mushroom with seafood‑like texture.

## Safety
- Generally well tolerated in studies; occasional GI upset or allergy possible.  
- **Drug interactions:** None well established; caution with other nootropics or anticoagulants pending better data.  
- **Pregnancy/lactation:** Insufficient evidence.

## Sourcing & Quality
- Choose brands specifying **species, part used (fruiting body vs mycelium), extraction ratio, and β‑glucan content**.  
- Third‑party testing for identity and contaminants is essential.
