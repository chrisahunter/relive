# Agaricus blazei (Agaricus subrufescens) — Practical Guide for Health Chatbots
_Last updated: 2025-10-10_

## Quick Take
Often labeled **Agaricus blazei Murill (ABM)** or **A. subrufescens**, this mushroom is rich in **β‑glucans** and has preclinical signals for **immune modulation**, **antitumor**, and **metabolic** effects. Human data are limited and heterogeneous.

## Identity & Compounds
- **Species:** *Agaricus subrufescens* (historically called *A. blazei Murrill*)  
- **Key compounds:** β‑glucans, proteoglycans, ergosterol, phenolics

## Evidence Snapshot
- **Immune/infection/oncology adjunct:** Preclinical and small human studies suggest benefits; evidence quality varies.  
- **Metabolic support:** Animal and early human signals for glycemic and lipid parameters.

## Safety
- Generally well tolerated; GI upset possible.  
- Rare case reports of **liver enzyme elevations** with some extracts; ensure sourcing from reputable manufacturers.  
- Theoretical interactions with anticoagulants and hypoglycemics.

## Forms & Dosing
- Capsules/powders/teas; standardization to β‑glucans where possible (e.g., >20%).  
- Typical labeled ranges: 1–3 g/day dry equivalent (varies widely).

## Chatbot Prompt Snippets
- “Is ABM the same as Agaricus subrufescens?”  
- “Does Agaricus have human cancer data?”  
- “How do β‑glucans work?”
